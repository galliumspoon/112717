    <h3>Grimm, <s>Fancy Boi</s> The Troupe Leader</h3>
    <p>Grimm is the main boss of the Grimm Troupe DLC.</p>
    <center><img src='../img/Grimm01.png'></img></center>
    <p>As shown in his title card, Grimm is the leader of the Grimm Troupe. He evolves into the Nightmare King later in the game.</p>
    <p>The Grimm Troupe is a circus like group of travelers that pass through old and dying civilizations to perform a ritual that replaces the old troupe leader with the Grimmkin, a small creature that evolves as you collect flames and is assumed to help preserve the heart.</p>
    <p>Grimm gifts you with the pin that gives you the Grimmkin and allows you to see the keepers of the flame.</p>
    <p>It is believed that Grimm is another entity similar to the Radiance after becoming the Nightmare King. This is because the dream essence tokens are shown but with a different color (indicating nightmares) and as the Nightmare King has the only full screen title card before the boss fight, besides the Radiance.</p>
