    <h3>Quirrel, The Scholar</h3>
    <p>Quirrel is the first NPC you meet ingame. He was once an assistant to the dreamer Monomon the Teacher, who wrote the elegy in the beginning of the game.</p>
    <p>The research he was believed to take part in involved the nature of the vessels and the wyrms. Monomon is notable for being against the containment of the infection as she believed it was bad for the kingdom.</p>

    <p>You meet Quirrel several times throughout the game and prefers using his mind to get out of conflict (or avoid it altogether), though it is noted that he uses his nail with some skill.</p>
    <p>The origins of his story are unknown, as his memory is gone. Only when he meets you at Monomon does he recover his memory and realize the mask on his head is Monomon's.</p>
    <p>Quirrel's last appearance in game is at the blue lake. It is assumed that he left Hallownest for good or committed suicide.</p>
