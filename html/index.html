    <p>Hollow Knight is a metroidvania style platformer developed by Team Cherry and released in February 2017.</p>
    <p>It was originally funded on Kickstarter, with a goal of AU$35,000. People pledged AU$57,138. This allowed the crew to reach the stretch goal of a second playable character, Hornet, which is coming in 2018.</p>
    <p>The game was developed on Unity and released for Mac, Linux, and Windows. They will be making a Switch version, as per the stretch goal.</p>
    <p>The second playable character, Hornet, will be available in 2018. Leading up to her release, Team Cherry has released two free DLCs, Hidden Dreams and The Grimm Troupe, with a third to be announced and released in 2018.</p>
    <p>Hidden Dreams and The Grimme Troupe had incrementally more information so the third DLC should hold some major answers and content.</p>
