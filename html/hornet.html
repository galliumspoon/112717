    <p>Hornet is a vessel-like creature that you encounter throughout the game and fight twice.</p>
    <p>It is suggested that she is considered a sibling of the vessels, due to the title of the "Sealed Siblings" ending, as well as her appearance, which is similar to that of the vessels.</p>
    <p>She was given to Herrah the Beast as a way to appease her and have her join the dreamers.</p>
    <p>Hornet is promised to be the second playable character, arriving in 2018, with a new character taking a similar place in her route.</p>
    <p>Hornet's weapon of choice is the needle and thread, which is presumably from the spiders that she grew up with.</p>
