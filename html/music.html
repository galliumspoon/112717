    <p>The Hollow Knight OST was created by Christopher Larkin and I would literally let him murder me.</p>
    <p>This game is already amazing, but the soundtrack is even better. Every single time I listen to it I get so many feelings, from the triumph of defeating the Mantis Lords to the sadness associated with the royal family to the dreamlike quality of Kingdom's Edge. Literally every single piece is gorgeous and fitting. If you listen through the album you'll get a pretty good idea of the overall theme of the kingdom and I just... Please listen. Please.</p>
